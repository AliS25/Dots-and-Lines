# Dots-and-Lines

**Dots-and-Lines** is a web program that allows users to create a graph and perform the breadth-first-search and depth-first-search algorithms to find a path between two nodes. The user can create an initial graph by clicking to create a circle and highlighting two circles to connect them. After creating a graph, the user can select a starting node and a target node. After that, the user can perform one of the two search algorithms. The program will highlight the path found in blue and the paths it tried in green and display a message listing the path from the start node to the target node. The user can then reset the graph and try the other search algorithm on the same graph. Alternatively, the user can reset the entire graph panel and start over.
